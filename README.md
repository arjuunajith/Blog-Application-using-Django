# Blog Application using Django

Simple blogging application with CRUD operations and REST APIs
 
First the models for a blog app in Django are built. Later the Django Rest Framework is added to transform it into a RESTful API. 

The server can be nitialized and run via manage.py with the runsever command from the commandline.
Users can be created via the same with the createsuperuser command.

Initially posts can be cretaed by navigating to localhost:8000/admin after starting up the local web server.

REST API and CRUD operations are implemented and can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/1/.
